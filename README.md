# Litter Decomposition Meta-Analysis
## Code associated with figures and data analysis in *Gill et. al. 2020* litter decomposition meta-analysis. 
This repository contains all code to replicate analyses and digures from *Gill et al. 2020. Experimental nitrogen fertilization globally accelerates, then slows decomposition of leaf litter*. 

In this study, we aggregated all published litter decomposition data from N fertilization experiments and fit four decomposition models to time series of litter mass loss data. The code and datasets provided here allow you to: 
1. Fit decomposition models (single exponential, double exponential, asymptotic exponential, and Weibull) to litter mass loss time series derived from published studies.
 - Data: Gill_NFertilization_MetaAnalysis_LitterHarvestData2.csv
 - Metadata: LitterHarvest_Metadata.csv
 - Code: Gill_NFertilization_MetaAnalysis_DecompModelFits.R
2. Evaluate model parameter fits across the dataset. Perform analyses presented in results paragraph 1 and 2; Figure 1 and S1; Table S1.
 - Data: Gill_NDeposition_MetaAnalysis_ParameterSummary.csv

3. Calculate parameter log response ratios and evaluate response distribution and relationship with predictor variables. Perform analyses presented in results paragraphs 3-7; Figures 2-4, Table S2-S7.
